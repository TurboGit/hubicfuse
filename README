HubicFuse is a FUSE application which provides access to Hubic's
cloud files via a mount-point.

This version contains support for DLO, symlinks and support to see other
tenant's containers. Those features are coming from:

   https://github.com/LabAdvComp/cloudfuse.git

BUILDING:

    You'll need libcurl, fuse, libssl, and libxml2 (and probably their dev
    packages) installed to build it.

    For CentOS or similar:
        $ yum install gcc make fuse-devel curl-devel libxml2-devel \
            openssl-devel json-c-devel file-devel

        $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/lib64/pkgconfig ./configure

    For GNU/Debian or Ubuntu:
        $ apt-get install gcc make curl libfuse-dev pkg-config \
            libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libjson-c-dev \
            libmagic-dev

  If you don't have git installed :
    sudo apt-get install git
  
  Download hubicfuse from git
    cd $HOME
    sudo git clone https://github.com/TurboGit/hubicfuse.git

  Install
    cd $HOME/hubicfuse
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install


USE:

  Retreive a refresh_token
    cd /$HOME/hubicfuse
    sudo ./hubic_token
    answer the questions, values in () are not default value, you have to enter them
  
  Create $HOME/.hubicfuse file (Hubic Cloud configuration file)
    cd /$HOME
    sudo nano .hubicfuse
      client_id=[Hubic client id for the registered application]
      client_secret=[Hubic client secret for the registered application]
      refresh_token=[A refresh token you got from the script]

    client_id, client_secret can be retrieved from the hubic
    web interface: https://hubic.com/home/browser/developers/

    The refresh_token can also be obtained from https://api.hubic.com

  Mount hubic
    mkdir /mnt/hubic
    sudo hubicfuse /mnt/hubic -o noauto_cache,sync_read,allow_other

  And finaly, it can be set in /etc/fstab
    hubicfuse /mnt/hubic fuse user,noauto 0 0

    It also inherits a number of command-line arguments and mount options from
    the Fuse framework.  The "-h" argument should provide a summary.

USE AS NON-ROOT:

    Add the user into the fuse group:

       $ sudo usermod -a -G fuse [username]

    Mount using the above command without the sudo. The .hubicfuse file is
    searched into the user's home.

    To unmount use:

       $ fusermount -u [chemin]

BUGS/SHORTCOMINGS:

    * rename() doesn't work on directories (and probably never will).
    * When reading and writing files, it buffers them in a local temp file.
    * It keeps an in-memory cache of the directory structure, so it may not be
      usable for large file systems.  Also, files added by other applications
      will not show up until the cache expires.
    * The root directory can only contain directories, as these are mapped to
      containers in cloudfiles.
    * Directory entries are created as empty files with the content-type
      "application/directory".
    * Cloud Files limits container and object listings to 10,000 items.
      cloudfuse won't list more than that many files in a single directory.
